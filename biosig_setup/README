About Biosig's Python interfaces. 
======================================

History: 
-------------------------------------------------
  In the past there were several attempts
  of providing Python support. A first attempt 
  using pure python should to be very slow and a 
  lot of implementation effort, only some early 
  version of GDF has been supported. 
  Later, Swig was used for providing a python binding. 
  This was reasonable flexible, and the libbiosig 
  implementation could be mostly used. Disadvantages 
  were the effort to maintin swig.i interface file, 
  which is currently most likely broken. Known issues 
  are string support, lack of Python3 support. Also this
  attempt is considered deprecated. 

  The third attempt is using "module extensions". 
  Currently, two functions, one for reading the header
  information (in JSON format) and one for reading the 
  data samples is provided. 

Usage: 
--------------------------------------------------
  - start python and run
  import biosig
  HDR=biosig.header("filename.gdf")
  print HDR
  Data=biosig.data("filename.gdf")
     
Installation: 
--------------------------------------------------
  make module 
  sudo make install 
  export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python$(PYVER)/dist-packages/
